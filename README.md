# BackupBot
Backs up a Discord server, including member roles, channels, message contents, and even attachments!

## IMPORTANT NOTE
The ToS is kind of iffy on having bots download entire guilds. It might be considered an abuse of the API,
since they mention scraping as one of the things you should not do "to harm Discord". If you are banned from
Discord for using this bot, don't say I didn't warn you (but I also have low expectations of that ever happening.)

This isn't a self-bot so scraping is the only somewhat possible ToS break.
